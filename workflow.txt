Setting up workflow.

Create script to run create mfp table.sql and then rip_data.py. This gets all the data into mySQL.

Need to create function to get a days data and load into mySQL.
Keep track of dates that need to be loaded unless there is a way to do it automatically. Could try to set up a job to run everyday.
